# JavaScript-Algorithms
Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in JavaScript.

## Editor
Everything in this repository is written using Google Chrome's Sources/Snippets.

## Source
Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/ . This excellent course with clear instructions taught me a lot about algorithms and data structures in general.

## Code
All code is written by me with examples from the instructor. It's not the best commented code or the best written code as I wanted to focus on learning the algorithms and data structures.
