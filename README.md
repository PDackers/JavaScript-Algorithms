# JavaScript-Algorithms
Algorithms and data structures that are implemented in JavaScript

## Editor
Everything in this repository is written using Google Chrome's Snippets.

## Source
This is the course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/. This excellent course with clear instructions taught me a lot about algorithms and data structures in general.

## Code
All the code is written by me with examples from the instructor. It's not the best commented or written code, as I wanted to focus on learning the algorithms and data structures.
